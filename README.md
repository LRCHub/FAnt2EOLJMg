[00:11.59] There's a distance between us
[00:16.57] It's getting hard to reach out
[00:22.16] Haven't seen you in seasons
[00:27.53] For all I hear is your voice
[00:41.53] 
[00:32.94] I know my limits
[00:36.34] You can break me down but
[00:38.82] I'll stay till the finish line
[00:43.87] 'Cause I've been counting minutes
[00:47.28] For quite some time now
[00:58.78] 
[00:49.70] Just to see you again
[00:54.14] And I've been counting days
[00:58.30] To get a way
[01:01.07] To see you again
[01:03.66] See you again
[01:06.47] Been fighting waves
[01:09.17] To get a way
[01:12.03] To see you again
[01:14.50] See you again
[01:21.00] 
[01:24.83] To see you again
[01:32.83] 
[01:35.60] To see you again
[01:43.60] 
[01:49.82] We've got millions of reasons
[01:55.43] To let it all go
[02:01.04] Hope we're not too broken
[02:06.04] I know I'm not always strong
[02:20.04] 
[02:11.01] And I've been counting days
[02:15.06] To get away
[02:18.08] To see you again
[02:20.76] See you again
[02:23.50] Been fighting waves
[02:26.17] To get a way
[02:29.15] To see you again
[02:31.58] See you again
[02:38.08] 
[02:41.44] To see you again
[02:49.44] 
[02:52.42] To see you again
[03:00.42] 
[03:03.42] To see you again
[03:11.42] 
[03:14.58] To see you again
